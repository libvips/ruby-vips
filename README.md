# Vips

This gem is a backwards compatible fork of `ruby-vips` but also includes (and compiles) the [libvips] source code.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ioquatix/vips.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/ioquatix/vips)

[libvips]: https://jcupitt.github.io/libvips

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'vips'
```

And then execute:

	$ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

	$ gem install vips

You'll still need to install `glib` and `gobject-introspection`.

## Usage

Exactly the same way as [ruby-vips].
